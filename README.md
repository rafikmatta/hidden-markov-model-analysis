# Hidden Markov Models Implementation

In this project we are modeling a learning problem as a Hidden Markov Model and applying the Baum Welch (BW) Algorithm 
to learn transition probabilities, emission probabilities and initial state probabilities. 
We are then using the Viterbi Algorithm to predict the state sequence based on the learned parameters and observations.
